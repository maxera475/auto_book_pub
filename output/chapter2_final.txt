Here is the rewritten chapter:

CHAPTER III: THE LITTLE SHIPS

A primitive canoe glided across the lagoon, its wooden hull glistening in the sunlight. The outrigger, a long, curved piece of wood attached to the side, provided stability as it navigated the choppy waters.

Aioma, a seasoned canoe-builder with keen eyes, watched as Dick expertly steered the vessel towards the northern beach. Katafa, waiting for him on shore, waved enthusiastically, her dark hair blowing in the wind.

As the canoe drew near, Aioma's gaze was drawn to an unusual sight - a small, wooden ship, its hull adorned with intricate carvings, riding the waves. It was as if the spirits of the sea had brought it to life, imbuing it with a sense of power and elegance.

Dick, noticing Aioma's fascination, sprang out of the canoe and rushed towards the dinghy, his long strides eating up the distance. "Look, Katafa!" he exclaimed, his eyes shining with excitement. "It's like nothing we've ever seen before!"

Aioma ambled after them, his worn hands cradling a bundle of wooden planks. As they approached the dinghy, he couldn't help but let out a low whistle.

"This thing," Aioma said, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "is an abomination. What kind of sorcery is this? Which end is which?" He chuckled, shaking his head in wonder.

Dick proudly held up the model ship, its delicate features and intricate details a testament to Kearney's skill as a craftsman. The tiny vessel seemed to come alive in Aioma's hands, its wooden hull flexing with an imaginary wind.

As they explored the dinghy together, their laughter and banter echoing across the lagoon, Dick felt a sense of belonging among these islanders. For a moment, the world seemed smaller, more manageable - and he was grateful for it.

As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the water, Aioma gazed out at the dinghy, his eyes narrowing in thought. "Kearney," he whispered, "what other secrets do you hold within those planks?"

And with that, Aioma vanished into the shadows, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of a smile - as if the spirits of the sea themselves had conjured up the mystery and magic that lay hidden beneath the surface.
